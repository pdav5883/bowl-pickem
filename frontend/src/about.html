      <h2 id="overview" class="mb-3">About bowl-pickem</h2>
      <p>
        Not as prestigous as its March cousin, College Football Bowl Season is a
        historically under-utilized opportunity for a low-stakes competition
        with family, friends, and other acquaintances. For at least a decade our
        family printed out bowl schedules and marked them with pens like cave
        people, tallying up scores every few days when someone got tired enough
        of hearing questions about who was in the lead. No more. After a
        successful alpha release just in time for the 2022 Bowl Season,
        <em>bowl-pickem</em> is ready for 2023 and beyond with a simple picking
        page and a snazzy scoreboard that updates mostly in real time.

      <p class="mb-3">
        If you navigate to the <a href="/picks.html">Picks</a> page you'll see
        dropdowns that allow you to select the year you would like to make picks
        for, and the game you would like to join. If this game is accepting
        picks, then you'll fill out the form and submit it with your name to be
        added to the scoreboard.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        Visit the <a href="/">Scoreboard</a> page to see how your picks are
        doing against your fellow competitors. As games are played, the
        scoreboard and leaderboard will update. If the first bowl hasn't started
        yet then you won't see everyone's picks.

      <h3 id="rules" class="mb-3">Rules</h3>

      <p>
        The rules couldn't be simpler - you pick a winner for each bowl, and if
        you are correct you get a point. All of the New Years Six bowls get a
        bonus point, and the National Championship gets two bonus points.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advanced" class="mb-3">Advanced Rules</h3>

      <p>
        The site supports two game types: Basic, where you just pick a winner
        for each bowl (see rules above); and Advanced, where you pick the winner
        and assign the bowl a "Category" from 1 to 6. If you pick the winner
        correctly, you get points equal to the category you assigned for the
        bowl. You have a fixed number of picks for each category, so you want to
        save your Category 6 picks for the no-doubters. The semi-finals and
        finals are automatically Category 3 picks, with bonus points same as
        above.
      </p>

      <h3 id="details" class="mb-3">Under the Hood</h3>

      <p>
        Relative to other BLR projects, <em>bowl-pickem</em> is pretty simple
        since there's not much interaction between you and the site once you
        submit your picks. Like all the other BLR projects, this one is
        statically hosted on AWS S3, using Cloudfront and Route 53 for content
        delivery.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        API gateway is used to define a set of endpoints that the frontend
        scripts running in your browser can call to interact with the
        <em>bowl-pickem</em> data. The API integrates with two Lambda functions
        that do all of the heavy lifting for user interacting with the site, and
        two more that allow admin updates:
      </p>

      <ul class="mb-3">
        <li>
          <strong>BowlsGetScoreboard</strong>: Query information about bowls and
          picks so that your browser can compute scores and build the
          scoreboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>BowlsUpdatePicks</strong>: Validate picks submitted by users
          and add them to the game data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>BowlsAdminEdit</strong>: Accept updates to bowl scores and
          game status.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>BowlsAdminAuth</strong>: Determines whether attemped admin
          edit is authorized by comparing secret to stored value.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Since the data for <em>bowl-pickem</em> is mostly static and I'm not
        expecting thousands of participants, I decided to use a super simple,
        inefficient, and not very robust "database" to store results and picks.
        Data is stored in a small set of JSON files on S3, which the Lambdas
        above either read or edit in order to perform their functions. This is
        compared to some of my other projects where data changes quite frequenty
        (or I just wanted to try something a bit fancier) and I set up an actual
        database in DynamoDB. It's much simpler this way, but it's not very
        efficient and doesn't have any protection against things like near
        simultaneous writes causing an overwrite.
